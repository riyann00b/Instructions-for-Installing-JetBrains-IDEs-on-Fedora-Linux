# Instructions for Installing JetBrains IDEs on Fedora Linux

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install JetBrains IDEs or any Linux `.tar.gz`/executable files on Fedora Linux. Additionally, it explains how to set up desktop entries for easy access.

---

## 🔄 1. Update Your System
Before diving in, let's make sure everything is up-to-date. Run:
```bash
sudo dnf update
```

---

## ☕ 2. Install Java (Just in Case)
Some JetBrains IDEs thrive on Java! Install it using:
```bash
sudo dnf install java-latest-openjdk
```

---

## 📂 3. Navigate to Your Downloads Folder
Head over to where you downloaded your `.tar.gz` files:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```

---

## 📦 4. Extract the Files
Time to unpack those IDE goodies! 🛠️
```bash
tar -xzf WebStorm-xxx.tar.gz
tar -xzf RustRover-xxx.tar.gz
tar -xzf pycharm-professional-xxx.tar.gz
```
> 🔍 Replace `xxx` with the version numbers of your downloaded files.

---

## 🛠️ 5. Move the IDEs to `/opt`
Let’s keep things organized by moving the extracted files to `/opt`:
```bash
sudo mv WebStorm-xxx /opt/webstorm
sudo mv RustRover-xxx /opt/rustrover
sudo mv pycharm-xxx /opt/pycharm
```

---

## 🔑 6. Make the Launch Scripts Executable
Set the right permissions for the main scripts:
```bash
sudo chmod +x /opt/webstorm/bin/webstorm.sh
sudo chmod +x /opt/rustrover/bin/rustrover.sh
sudo chmod +x /opt/pycharm/bin/pycharm.sh
```
> 📝 If the executable doesn’t have a `.sh` extension, use the provided name instead.

---

## 📋 7. Create Desktop Entries
Let’s make it easy to launch your IDEs like a pro! 😎

### Example for WebStorm 🌟
Run:
```bash
sudo nano ~/.local/share/applications/webstorm.desktop
```

Add this content:
```
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Name=WebStorm
Exec=/opt/webstorm/bin/webstorm.sh
Icon=/opt/webstorm/bin/webstorm.png
Comment=JavaScript IDE
Categories=Development;IDE;
Terminal=false
```
> Repeat for RustRover and PyCharm, updating the `Exec` and `Icon` paths. 🎯

---

## 🛠️ 8. Update Desktop Database
Refresh the application database to include your new entries:
```bash
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
```

---

## 🚀 9. Launch the IDEs
You’re all set to launch your IDEs! 🎉

### From the Application Menu 📂
Find your IDEs in the application menu and click away! 🖱️

### From the Terminal ⚡
Use these commands to launch:
```bash
/opt/webstorm/bin/webstorm.sh
/opt/rustrover/bin/rustrover.sh
/opt/pycharm/bin/pycharm.sh
```

---

## 🌟 10. (Optional) Create Desktop Shortcuts
Want quick access from your desktop? Create shortcuts! 🚀

- Right-click on your desktop.
- Select **Create New Launcher**.
- Use the information from the `.desktop` files you created earlier.

---

🎉 **And that’s it!** You’re ready to code like a rockstar on Fedora Linux. Enjoy your JetBrains IDEs! 🌈✨
